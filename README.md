2DExplore - JS
==============

[try me!](https://SopaXorzTaker.github.io/2dexplore-js)

This is a port of a sandbox game 2DExplore in HTML5.
See: [2dexplore](https://github.com/SopaXorzTaker/2dexplore)

Controls
----
Use keys `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the player.
`Q` creates a new world, and `Z`-`X` switch the tile type.

Mouse: left-click on a empty space to set a tile in it (the default tile is air, so try using `X` before.)
Right-clicking a tile will clean it.
Middle-click will sample the tile clicked.
